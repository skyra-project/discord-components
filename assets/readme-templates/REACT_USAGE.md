### Important

React is currently the only library among the "big" libraries for frontend
development that does not fully support custom elements / webcomponents yet (see
[this React documentation page for more info](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components#custom-html-elements)).
For this reason we ship the package `@skyra/discord-components-react`.

We sincerely hope that this situation will improve in the future, but no one
knows what their plans are.

### Using the Discord font

This library can use the Discord font if you load it into your project. You can
do so by including the CSS below:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Whitney';
  src: url('https://cdn.skyra.pw/whitney-font/v2/Book.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: 400;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Whitney';
  src: url('https://cdn.skyra.pw/whitney-font/v2/Medium.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: 500;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Whitney';
  src: url('https://cdn.skyra.pw/whitney-font/v2/Semibold.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: 600;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Whitney';
  src: url('https://cdn.skyra.pw/whitney-font/v2/Bold.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Vite

### Create React App

#### Important Notes

Create React App is no longer the recommended way to start with a React app as
per React's own documentation. We very strongly recommend using Vite instead.

### NextJS

#### Known limitations

1. All the React components will only render on the client, they are bundled
   with the `'use client';` header that NextJS expects for CSR only components.
   This is because there is currently no good way to render webcomponents on the
   server. When
   [@lit-labs/nextjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/nextjs) adds
   [support for the app directory](https://github.com/lit/lit/issues/3657) we
   can revisit this limitation.

2. When using the app directory we are not able to get profiles working. We are
   open to suggestions on how to fix this, ideally through a pull request to
   [https://github.com/skyra-project/discord-components-implementations/tree/main/templates/nextjs-ts].
